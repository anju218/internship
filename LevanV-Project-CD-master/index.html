			<h3>Campus Drone</h3>
			<hr id="hr-line">
			<p>
				Campus Drone is an e-magazine founded in the year August, 2020. It is
				subsidiary company owned by LevanV. It is basically a way we
				deciphered in our quest to find best practices beneficial to students 
				everywhere. It’s a magazine with contents which are curated to induce 
				interest, zeal and curiosity in every aspiring student.The team of “Campus Drone” gives every person online the opportunity
				to create good content and express a wide variety of knowledge. We
				 primarily focus on the ideas that provide a roadmap for future.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our motto is to give our precious knowledge acquired from many
                         intellectuals, scholars to the young and enthusiastic minds. This inspires
                          and influences the fresh and new graduates. Our company also reminds

                             We appoint a group of campus ambassadors in the colleges associated with us.
                              So, these campus ambassadors act as a barrier between our company and the colleges.
                               They help us to make information about concerned colleges and also 
                               conveys to the students about the contemporaries of the company.

			<h3>Market Potential</h3>
			<hr id="hr-line">
			<p>
				The more information we get, the world becomes a better place to live 
                in. Magazines are generally issued monthly and the class of persons
                 who read them varies according to the type of the magazines. The
                  magazine may be devoted to literature, politics, fiction or a mixture of
                   stories and articles. It is the purest medium to access the readers by
                    providing in-depth and concise information. They engage the audience
                     with their excellent layout and design which helps them to reinforce
                      the key concepts of their own choice. The visual strength of magazine is
                       enhanced with the effective use of colour in magazine. They ideally
                        cover all the themes depending on the interest of the readers. People 
                        tend to read magazine at a slow rate, typically over a couple of days, so
                         they offer an opportunity to use detailed copy.  Magazines generally
                          have a longer life than other types of press advertising. The results of
                           such advertising can be spread over an extended period as magazines
                            are often preserved and filed by the readers.

			<h3>Role of School and College Magazines in Education</h3>
			<hr id="hr-line">
			<p>
				Magazines published from Schools and Colleges have great importance in education. 
                These magazines often reflect the image of the educational institution through the
                 articles presented by the students and teachers. School and College magazines are great
                 way to encourage the creativity in students which makes them effectively utilize language 
                 for conveying ideas. The true potential in writing among students can only be recognized through
                  the work in magazines because there will not be much exposure in other ways.
			</p>
			<p>
				School and College magazines are the most appropriate platform for students for exposure to 
                      the artistic potential among peer. Most of the budding talents in school, gives opportunity to 
                      showcase their work through school magazines. The articles published in the school magazine
                       also allows teachers to motivate the young readers. Teachers can also help students to improve
                        their language by giving proper suggestions and encouragement. As there are different kind of 
                        literature being published on school magazines, students can choose categories based on their 
                        interest for publishing in them. It also helps the students to know about inter and intra college
                         news to expand their connectivity and ideas to explore beyond the clouds. This will aid the students
                          to do research on topics on their own choice of interest.

			<h3>Why Digital Magazines?</h3>
			<hr id="hr-line">
			<p>Usually magazines are available in two formats</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Digital format</li>
				<li>Printed format</li>
			</ul>
			<div align="left">
				<p>
					Printed magazine has started to decline in popularity and diffusion because of increasingly
						 advantages of digital magazines as the people are tending to digitalization. Some of them includes:
				</p>
				<p>•	Lower cost: A paper magazine has to be printed, distributed and 
					finally sold. These three processes, incur a lot of cost. Digital, on the contrary,
					 allows publishers to distribute their magazines on the web, without having to pay the commercial mediation of suppliers and sellers.</p>
				<p>•	Distribution: There is no need to spend money on distributors and every issue of the magazine can be potentially 
						 bought by anyone in the world.</p>
				<p>•	Access for the reader: The reader can get the magazine anywhere and at anytime.</p> 
				<p>•	Virality: This era has brought new ways to for the users to connect their audience through social media sites. This can increase ease of sharing it anyone.</p>
				<p>•	Interaction: Through these social media sites, users can also contact with the company through comments, likes and private messages.
					   This would be a great chance to listen to the audience feedback to improve in the next volume.</p>

				<h3>Advertisements in Magazine</h3>
				<hr id="hr-line">
				<p>Readers report that they are most influenced by magazines than any other media.Magazines are
					more trusted, inspiring and motivating than other media among young adults. Almost 30% of the world reads magazines. 
				   By using magazines as a medium for advertising, an appeal can be made to a large body of persons with similar tastes or covering a large area.</p>
				   <p>•	Targeted Reach: Different magazines will have different audience. Through magazine advertisements, we can find the right magazine for the right audience to place the ads strategically.</p>
				   <p>•	Brand Recognition and Credibility: Many magazines are well-respected among their targeted audience usually the level of trust is elevated. Advertisers can greatly benefit from this credibility when their ads are viewed not as ads but as recommendations from a trusted source.</p>
				   <p>•	Pass-on Readership: Many people pass on magazines to their friends and family members. This likely increases the reach of the advertisement to more potential customers.</p>
